permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'Data visualizations are commonplace in both our professional and
personal lives. From workplace dashboards to our health charts to
spending trackers—we interact with them almost every day. How-
ever, despite their crucial role in communicating information to us,
many people still struggle to effectively use these tools and draw
meaningful insights from them. This issue is particularly acute in
developing countries where language barriers and limited tech-
nology skills present additional challenges for data visualization
literacy. In this paper, we present Vizard: a dashboard companion
that uses large language models to analyze data visualizations for
users and explain their elements in their language of choice, as well
as providing insights and recommendations based on the trends
observed according to the user’s industry and job role. We pair this
with a novel framework for evaluating visualization literacy which
uses procedurally generated questions that are tailored to partici-
pants’ interests and current visualization literacy level. We make
Vizard open source to encourage more research in this direction.'
