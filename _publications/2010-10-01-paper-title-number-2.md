excerpt: 'Graph databases have emerged as a powerful tool for representing
and analyzing complex relationships in various domains, includ-
ing social networks, healthcare, and financial systems. Despite
their growing popularity, data quality issues such as node dupli-
cation, missing nodes or edges, incorrect formats, stale data, and
misconfigured topology remain prevalent. While there are numer-
ous libraries and approaches for addressing data quality in tabular
data, graph-structured data pose unique challenges of their own.
In this paper, we explore an automated approach for detecting data
quality issues in graph structured data which focuses on both node
attributes and relationships. Since data quality is often governed
by pre-established rules and is highly context-dependent, our ap-
proach seeks to balance rule-based control with the automation
potential of machine learning. We investigate the capabilities of
graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and large language models
(LLMs) at detecting data quality issues using a few-shot learning
approach. We evaluate the data quality detection rates of these
models on a graph dataset and compare their effectiveness and
potential impact on improving data quality. Our results indicate
that LLMs exhibit robust generalization capabilities from limited
samples while GCNs offer distinct advantages in certain contexts.'
